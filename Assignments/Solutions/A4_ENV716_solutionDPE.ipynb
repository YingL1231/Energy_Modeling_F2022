So by dividing the big task of creating the function for 2c into three smaller tasks (the simpler function of 2b and two dictionaries), we can divide and conquer. Also, both the function of 2b and the dictionaries can be re-used as building blocks to define other functions, other dictionaries etc...\n","Nevertheless, some could like the second version, specially if it contained all the constants, and the dictionary inside, because the code could be easier to read and perhaps also to mantain (modify, reuse, and document).
