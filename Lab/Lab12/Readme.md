# Lab 12 - Simulating Random Variable in Python

Learning goals:

1. Get familiar with library random and how to set the seed for random number generation;
2. Simulate a coin flip and roll a die using random.randint();
2. Simulate a coin flip using np.random and the binomial distribution;
3. Get familiar with the library scipy.stats and its functions rvs(), cdf() and pdf() using the binomial and the continuous uniform distribution.
