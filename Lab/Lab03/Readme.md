# Lab 03 - More on Filtering Data Sets and Pivot Tables in Python

Learning goals:
* Learn how to change column type from character to float/int;
* Learn how to create pivot tables from a data frame using function pivot_table();
* Learn how to save your table as an excel file.


This Lab will teach you how to import and manipulate e-grid with Python. To open the file for Lab 03 follow the steps below.

* Step 1: Open your google drive, navigate to you "Colab Notebooks" <br>
* Step 2: Click on the plus sign on the upper left **+ New** and navigate to "Google Colaboratory". It should be under *More*. <br>
* Step 3: Select *File* and then *Open Notebook*. <br>
* Step 2: In the pop-up window navigate to the *GitHub tab* and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available *.ipynb* files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file one you want to open. In this case "*Lab03/Lab03_PivotTables.ipynb*".
* Step 5: Select *File* and then *Save a Copy to Drive*. A new tab should appear on your browser with a file named "Copy of Lab03_PivotTables.ipynb". Rename this file to eliminate the "Copy of" part. <br>

Note that it was automatically saved on your drive folder named "Colab Notebooks". You can now make any edits/changes to your notebook and it will be stored on your drive. <br>

Make sure you have a copy of the 'e-grid2020_data.xlsx' file on you drive before you run the code.
