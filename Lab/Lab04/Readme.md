# Lab 4 - UDFs and dictionaries in Python

Learning goals:

1. Learn how to create and call user defined functions;
2. Learn how to create dictionaries in Python to improve your UDF;
3. Learn how to export/share your Colab script;
4. Learn how to format your output with format() and placeholders.

To open the file for Lab 04 follow the steps below.

* Step 1: Open your google drive, navigate to your "Colab Notebooks" <br>
* Step 2: Click on the plus sign on the upper left **+ New** and navigate to "Google Colaboratory". It should be under *More*. <br>
* Step 3: Select *File* and then *Open Notebook*. <br>
* Step 2: In the pop-up window navigate to the *GitHub tab* and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available *.ipynb* files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file you want to open.
* Step 5: Select *File* and then *Save a Copy to Drive*. A new tab should appear on your browser with a file named "Copy of ...". Rename this file to eliminate the "Copy of" part. <br>

Note that it was automatically saved on your drive folder named "Colab Notebooks". You can now make any edits/changes to your notebook and it will be stored on your drive. <br>

**Additional resources**

Below you will find two videos. The first is showing how to create a temperature converter UDF (same example from lecture) with details about syntax and arguments.
The second shows how to create a dictionary to improve the temperature converter UDF. The dictionary will associate all the possible ways the user can spell out the temperature unit with a a pre-specified string that the function can recognize.
