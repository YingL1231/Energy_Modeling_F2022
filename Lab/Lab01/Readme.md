# Lab 1 - Intro to Python | Simple Operations | Defining objects

To open the file for Lab 1 follow the steps below.

* Step 1: Open your google drive, navigate to you "Colab Notebooks" <br>
* Step 2: Click on the plus sign on the upper left **+ New** and navigate to "Google Colaboratory". It should be under *More*. <br>
* Step 3: Select *File* and then *Open Notebook*. <br>
* Step 2: In the pop-up window navigate to the *GitHub tab* and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available *.ipynb* files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file one you want to open. In this case "*Lab/Lab01/Lab01_SimpleCalculation.ipynb*".
* Step 5: Select *File* and then *Save a Copy to Drive*. A new tab should appear on your browser with a file named "Copy of Lab01_SimpleCalculation.ipynb". Rename thsi file to eliminate the "Copy of" part. <br>

Note that it was automatically saved on your drive folder named "Colab Notebooks". You can now make any edits/changes to your notebook and it will be stored on your drive. <br>

In this first script you will learn how to make simple math operations, create variables and lists in Python.

In case you miss a class here are some available recordings for this week. <br>
