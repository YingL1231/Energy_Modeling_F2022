# Lab 1 - Intro to Python | Simple Operations | Defining objects




If you choose to use Google Colab, you do not need to install Python and any other library in your machine. You will create you *.ipynb* file and run it using Google's GPU. With Google Colab you can open the file directly from the class Github repository.

* Step 1: Go to "https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb". <br>
* Step 2: Select: File > Open Notebook. <br>
* Step 3: In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available *.ipynb* files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file one you want to open. You can now run and make any changes to this file. Make sure you save a copy of this file and any changes to your google drive before closing it. <br>

* Step 1: Go to "**https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb**". <br>
* Step 2: Select: File > Open Notebook. <br>
* Step 3: In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file one you want to open. In this case it will be "Lab1_SimpleCalculation.ipynb".
