# Lab 7 - Linear Programming with FOR Loops

Learning goals:

1. More on Macros in Excel - Look at handout H13;
2. Solving LP with a FOR loop;
3. Implement a LP model using numpy arrays (Approach 2).

To open the file for Lab 07 follow the steps below.

* Step 1: Open your google drive, navigate to your "Colab Notebooks" <br>
* Step 2: Click on the plus sign on the upper left **+ New** and navigate to "Google Colaboratory". It should be under *More*. <br>
* Step 3: Select *File* and then *Open Notebook*. <br>
* Step 2: In the pop-up window navigate to the *GitHub tab* and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available *.ipynb* files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file you want to open.
* Step 5: Select *File* and then *Save a Copy to Drive*. A new tab should appear on your browser with a file named "Copy of ...". Rename this file to eliminate the "Copy of" part. <br>
