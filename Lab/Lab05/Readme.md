# Lab 5 - Manipulating Data frames and Intro to LP

Learning goals:

1. Discuss the “how” argument of pd.merge dataframes
2. Intro to the Pyomo library for solving optimizations models
3. Solver integration, adjusting paths

To open the file for Lab 05 follow the steps below.

* Step 1: Open your google drive, navigate to your "Colab Notebooks" <br>
* Step 2: Click on the plus sign on the upper left **+ New** and navigate to "Google Colaboratory". It should be under *More*. <br>
* Step 3: Select *File* and then *Open Notebook*. <br>
* Step 2: In the pop-up window navigate to the *GitHub tab* and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available *.ipynb* files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file you want to open.
* Step 5: Select *File* and then *Save a Copy to Drive*. A new tab should appear on your browser with a file named "Copy of ...". Rename this file to eliminate the "Copy of" part. <br>

Note that it was automatically saved on your drive folder named "Colab Notebooks". You can now make any edits/changes to your notebook and it will be stored on your drive. <br>

**Additional resources**

If you are using Jupyter notebook to run the notebooks you will need to follow the steps described in the "Optional_Pyomo_101_MacUsers" or "Optional_Pyomo_101_PCUsers".
