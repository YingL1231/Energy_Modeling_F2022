# Course Set Up

As mentioned in the lecture in this course you will learn how to perform simple calculations, rearrange data sets and solve optimization models in Python. We will use Jupyter notebooks which means our scripts you have python code and simple text. The extension of Jupyter python notebooks is *.ipynb*. You have three options to run Python scripts.

* **Option 1 (preferred):** Using Google Colaboratory on Duke machines or personal laptop. That the one we will use in the labs. <br>
* **Option 2:** Using Duke Jupyter Notebook Container on Duke machines or personal laptop. <br>
* **Option 3:** Using Jupyter notebook and Anaconda on your personal computer, i.e., running the scripts locally in your computer.  <br>

Options 1 and 2 do not require any software installation. Option 1 is preferred because you can keep running Python scripts on your personal computer after you graduate, while the Jupyter containers will only be available to you while you are at Duke.

# Option 1: Getting Started With Google Colab and Python

If you choose to use Google Colab, you do not need to install Python and any other library in your machine. You will create you .ipynb file and run it using Google's GPU. With Google Colab you can open the file directly from the class Github repository.

* Step 1: Go to "**https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb**". <br>
* Step 2: Select: File > Open Notebook. <br>
* Step 3: In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file one you want to open. In this case it will be "Lab1_SimpleCalculation.ipynb". You can now run and make any changes to this file. Make sure you save a copy of this file and any changes to your google drive before closing it. <br>

# Option 2: Jupyter Containers

An alternative to using Nicholas School machines or installing Anaconda and Python on a personal machine is to use one of Duke’s Jupyter containers. With this option there is no need to install any software. You can access your Jupyter session anywhere from any machine via a web browser.

You will you need to creating/set up your Jupyter container.

* Step 1: Navigate to https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers and log in.
* Step 2: Click on the reserve Jupyter button.

You now have a dedicated Jupyter machine. At the end of the semester Duke IT will send a message asking whether you want to extend your reservation.

When you need to resume work, simply return to the https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers site and log in. You’ll see a button to access your existing container.

# Option 3: Getting Started With Python on your personal computer

Please follow the instructions on the Python 101 file and make sure everything is running on your computer.
There are two Python 101 files, one for Mac users and one for PC users.

Once Python is up and running and you got your "Hello World" message, you are ready to run your first .ipynb script.

* Step 1: Locate the file in the Github repo, for example <i> Lab1_SimpleCalculation.ipynb </i>. <br>
* Step 2: Right-click on <i> Raw > Download Linked File As </i>. Save it on a local folder in your machine. <br>
* Step 3: Open Jupyter notebook using your terminal (for Mac users) or Anaconda (for PC users). <br>
* Step 4: From the list of folders that appear on Jupyter web application, find the folder were you saved the <i> .ipynb </i> file. <br>
* Step 5: After you locate the file, click on it to open. Remember that to run it locally you need to perform the installation steps from Python 101 files. <br>


# Simple Calculation

In this first script you will learn how to make simple math operations, create variables and lists in Python.
