# Lab 6 - Linear Programming in Python with PYOMO

Learning goals:

1. Intro to the Pyomo library for solving optimizations models;
2. Solver integration, adjusting paths;
3. Look at file for Lab06_IntroLP_Part1;
4. Implement other LP examples.

To open the file for Lab 05 follow the steps below.

* Step 1: Open your google drive, navigate to your "Colab Notebooks" <br>
* Step 2: Click on the plus sign on the upper left **+ New** and navigate to "Google Colaboratory". It should be under *More*. <br>
* Step 3: Select *File* and then *Open Notebook*. <br>
* Step 2: In the pop-up window navigate to the *GitHub tab* and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available *.ipynb* files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file you want to open.
* Step 5: Select *File* and then *Save a Copy to Drive*. A new tab should appear on your browser with a file named "Copy of ...". Rename this file to eliminate the "Copy of" part. <br>

Note that it was automatically saved on your drive folder named "Colab Notebooks". You can now make any edits/changes to your notebook and it will be stored on your drive. <br>

**Additional resources**

If you are using Jupyter notebook to run the notebooks you will need to follow the steps described in the "Optional_Pyomo_101_MacUsers" or "Optional_Pyomo_101_PCUsers".
