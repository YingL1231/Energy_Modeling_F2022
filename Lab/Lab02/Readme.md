# Lab 2 - Reading Data Sets in Python

Learning goals: 
* How to read excel spreadsheets in Python;
* How to slice you large data set into a smaller data set;
* How to filter rows and columns;
* How to get summary values.

This Lab will teach you how to import and manipulate e-grid with Python. To open the file for Lab 2 follow the steps below.

* Step 1: Open your google drive, navigate to you "Colab Notebooks" <br>
* Step 2: Click on the plus sign on the upper left **+ New** and navigate to "Google Colaboratory". It should be under *More*. <br>
* Step 3: Select *File* and then *Open Notebook*. <br>
* Step 2: In the pop-up window navigate to the *GitHub tab* and locate our repository "ENV716/Energy_Modeling_F2022". All available *.ipynb* files should appear in the list. <br>
* Step 4: Choose the file one you want to open. In this case "*Lab/Lab02/Lab02_Exploring_egrid.ipynb*".
* Step 5: Select *File* and then *Save a Copy to Drive*. A new tab should appear on your browser with a file named "Copy of Lab01_SimpleCalculation.ipynb". Rename thsi file to eliminate the "Copy of" part. <br>

Note that it was automatically saved on your drive folder named "Colab Notebooks". You can now make any edits/changes to your notebook and it will be stored on your drive. <br>

Make sure you have a copy of the e-grid 2020 file on you drive before you run the code.

Details on the libraries and function used in Lab 2 script can be found in these two videos. The first video is mainly importing the data set from the e-grid spreadsheet GEN18. And the second video shows how to slice and filter the data set. Note that on this videos we use an older version of e-grid with Jupyter Notebook.
